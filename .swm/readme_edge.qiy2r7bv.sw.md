[![CI](https://github.com/blackcandy-org/black_candy/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/blackcandy-org/black_candy/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/blackcandy-org/blackcandy/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/blackcandy-org/black_candy?branch=master) [![Ruby Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/testdouble/standard) ![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/blackcandy/blackcandy)

Black Candy is a self-hosted music streaming server, your personal music center.

## Try The Demo

Please visit <https://demo.blackcandy.org> and use demo user (email: [admin@admin.com](mailto:admin@admin.com), password: foobar) to log in. And feel free to try it.

> \[!NOTE\] This demo user does not have administrator privileges. So you cannot experience all the features in Black Candy. And all music in the demo are from [Free Music Archive](https://freemusicarchive.org/). You can check their [licenses](https://github.com/blackcandy-org/blackcandy/blob/master/docs/demo_music_licenses.md).

## Installation

Black Candy uses docker image to install easily. You can run Black Candy like this.

```shell
docker run -p 80:80 ghcr.io/blackcandy-org/blackcandy:latest 

# Or pull from Docker Hub.
docker run -p 80:80 blackcandy/blackcandy:latest 
```

That's all. Now, you can access either <http://localhost> or <http://host-ip> in a browser, and use initial admin user to log in (email: [admin@admin.com](mailto:admin@admin.com), password: foobar).

## Upgrade

> \[!IMPORTANT\] If you upgrade to a major version, you need to read the upgrade guide carefully before upgrade. Because there are some breaking changes in a major version.
>
> - See [V3 Upgrade](https://github.com/blackcandy-org/blackcandy/blob/master/docs/v3_upgrade.md) for upgrade from V2 release.
> - See [Edge Upgrade](https://github.com/blackcandy-org/blackcandy/blob/master/docs/edge_upgrade.md) for upgrade from edge release to latest stable release.

Upgrade Black Candy is pull new image from remote. Then remove an old container and create a new one.

```shell
docker pull ghcr.io/blackcandy-org/blackcandy:latest
docker stop <your_blackcandy_container>
docker rm <your_blackcandy_container>
docker run <OPTIONS> ghcr.io/blackcandy-org/blackcandy:latest 
```

With docker compose, you can upgrade Black Candy like this:

```shell
docker pull ghcr.io/blackcandy-org/blackcandy:latest
docker-compose down
docker-compose up
```

## Mobile Apps

Black Candy mobile apps are available in the following app stores:

For Android app, you can also download APK from [GitHub Release](https://github.com/blackcandy-org/android/releases/latest)

## Configuration

### Port Mapping

Black Candy exports the 80 port. If you want to be able to access it from the host, you can use the `-p` option to map the port.

```shell
docker run -p 3000:80 ghcr.io/blackcandy-org/blackcandy:latest
```

### Media Files Mounts

You can mount media files from host to container and use `MEDIA_PATH` environment variable to set the media path for black candy.

```shell
docker run -v /media_data:/media_data -e MEDIA_PATH=/media_data ghcr.io/blackcandy-org/blackcandy:latest   
```

### Use PostgreSQL As Database

Black Candy use SQLite as database by default. Because SQLite can simplify the process of installation, and it's an ideal choice for self-hosted small server. If you think SQLite is not enough, or you are using some cloud service like heroku to host Black Candy, you can also use PostgreSQL as database.

```shell
docker run -e DB_ADAPTER=postgresql -e DB_URL=postgresql://yourdatabaseurl ghcr.io/blackcandy-org/blackcandy:latest 
```

### How to Persist Data

All the data that need to persist in Black Candy are stored in `/app/storage`, So you can mount this directory to host to persist data.

```shell
mkdir storage_data

docker run -v ./storage_data:/app/storage ghcr.io/blackcandy-org/blackcandy:latest 
```

### Logging

Black Candy logs to `STDOUT` by default. So if you want to control the log, Docker already supports a lot of options to handle the log in the container. See: <https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/configure/>.

## Edge Version

The edge version of Black Candy base on master branch, which means it's not stable, you may encounter data loss or other issues. However, I don't recommend normal user using an edge version. But if you are a developer who wants to test or contribute to Black Candy, you can use the edge version.

```shell
docker pull ghcr.io/blackcandy-org/blackcandy:edge
```
